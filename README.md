# Wine-data-quality
The ability to predict wine quality accurately can greatly benefit both producers and consumers in the wine industry. In this study, we explore the application of machine learning techniques to predict the quality of red and white wines based on their physicochemical properties. Using a publicly available wine quality dataset, we apply several classification algorithms, including Support Vector Machines (SVM), Random Forest, and Decision Trees, to build models that can predict wine quality scores. The dataset consists of multiple features, including alcohol content, acidity, sugar levels, and pH. We evaluate the performance of each model using accuracy, confusion matrix analysis, and other metrics, such as precision, recall, and F1-score. Our results indicate that Support Vector Machines achieved the highest accuracy in predicting wine quality. The findings highlight the effectiveness of machine learning approaches in quality prediction and provide insights into the key factors influencing wine quality. This study contributes to the growing field of data-driven decision-making in the food and beverage industry and offers valuable implications for quality control and consumer preferences.
